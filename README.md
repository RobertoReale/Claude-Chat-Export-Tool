# Claude Chat Export Tool

This tool allows users to export their chat conversations from the Claude chat interface as a Markdown file. It extracts both user messages and Claude's responses, including any reasoning content, and formats them neatly for easy reading and sharing.

## Features

- Extracts user messages and Claude's responses from the chat interface.
- Cleans the extracted content to remove unnecessary elements like user initials and UI elements.
- Handles various content types, including text, code blocks, lists, and math expressions.
- Includes reasoning content in a dropdown format within the Markdown.
- Generates a downloadable Markdown file with a filename based on the chat title and the current date.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Set up the Bookmarklet**:
   - Create a new bookmark in your web browser.
   - Name it something like "Export Claude Chat".
   - In the URL field, paste the minified code from the `pt2.js` file in this repository.
   - Make sure the code is minified to fit within the bookmarklet's size limits.

2. **Run the Bookmarklet**:
   - Navigate to the Claude chat page you want to export.
   - Click the bookmarklet you created.
   - The tool will extract the conversation and prompt you to download the Markdown file.

## Example

Here's an example of what the exported Markdown might look like:

```markdown

The problem is: Solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 7.

## ðŸ¤– Claude

To solve for x in the equation 2x + 3 = 7, follow these steps:

1. Subtract 3 from both sides:
   2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3
   2x = 4

2. Divide both sides by 2:
   2x / 2 = 4 / 2
   x = 2

So, the solution is x = 2.
